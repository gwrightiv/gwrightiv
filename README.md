# 👋 Hi, I'm Graham Wright

I'm a junior system administrator and cloud support tech-in-training with hands-on experience deploying and managing Windows Server environments in Azure and locally. I specialize in Active Directory, PowerShell automation, and securing Windows environments through practical labs and real-world simulations.
